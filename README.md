# Uni_Student_Managment_System
The Student Management System is a C program designed to manage student  information efficiently. It allows the user to perform various operations such as  adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a student by ID,  updating student details, calculating the average GPA, and finding the student  with the highest GPA. 
This system utilizes fundamental programming concepts including conditions,  loops, strings, structs, and pointers, besides the ability to use data structures  efficiently like the linked list.
